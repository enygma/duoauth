PHP Library for easy integration with [Duo Security](http://duosecurity.com)'s Two-Factor REST API

The Duo Security service provides easy integration with your current authentication methods
to drop in two-factor authentication (cell phone or other device).

They have a "developer" plan that's free and allows for up to 10 users on the application/account.
